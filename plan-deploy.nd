I can see you're getting a 404 error when trying to access `/api/generateBilling` and a JSON parsing error. Let me examine your current code to understand the issue and provide a plan.

Read file: src/App.jsx
Read file: functions/generateBilling.ts
Read file: vercel.json

Now I understand the issue! Here's my analysis and plan:

## **Problem Analysis:**

1. **404 Error**: Your frontend is trying to call `/api/generateBilling` but there's no API endpoint set up for local development
2. **JSON Parsing Error**: The 404 response isn't valid JSON, causing the parsing error
3. **Configuration Mismatch**: You have Vercel serverless functions configured, but they only work when deployed to Vercel, not in local development

## **Root Causes:**

1. **Missing Local API**: The `functions/generateBilling.ts` file contains Vercel configuration instead of actual API logic
2. **No Local Development Server**: Vite is only serving the frontend, not the API endpoints
3. **Wrong File Structure**: The `vercel.json` references `api/generateBilling.ts` but your file is in `functions/generateBilling.ts`

## **Plan to Fix:**

### **Phase 1: Set up Local Development Environment**
1. **Create a proper API endpoint** - Replace the current `functions/generateBilling.ts` with actual API logic
2. **Set up a local development server** - Use Express.js or similar to serve both frontend and API
3. **Fix file structure** - Ensure API files are in the correct location

### **Phase 2: Implement the API Logic**
1. **Create the generateBilling endpoint** - Handle POST requests with proper error handling
2. **Add AI integration** - Connect to an AI service (OpenAI, etc.) for generating billing entries
3. **Add proper CORS handling** - Allow frontend to communicate with local API

### **Phase 3: Environment Configuration**
1. **Set up environment variables** - For API keys and configuration
2. **Add development scripts** - Update package.json for local development
3. **Test the complete flow** - Ensure frontend can successfully call the API

### **Phase 4: Deployment Preparation**
1. **Fix Vercel configuration** - Update vercel.json to match your actual file structure
2. **Ensure production compatibility** - Make sure the same code works both locally and on Vercel

## **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Create a proper API server** (Express.js with Vite integration)
2. **Implement the generateBilling endpoint** with actual AI integration
3. **Update the frontend** to use the correct local development URL
4. **Add proper error handling** to prevent JSON parsing errors

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan? I can start by setting up the local development environment and creating the proper API endpoint.
